# Green Open Spaces in the Center of Seattle<br>
### :newspaper: Introduction
This project is intended to visualize the spatial distribution of green open spaces in the center of City Seattle.  Major parks that are identified at this leaflet are located in **`Magnolia`** in the West, **`Phinney Ridge`** in the center, **`Windermer`** in the East, and **`Madison Street`** in the South. Highway is stressed in the leaflet to emphasize how the **`I-5 Express`** (red) and **`99`** (brown) provide great accessbility to these parks and also reduce the safety level of  the park users.<br>

### :hammer: Tiles, Geographic Area, and Zoom Levels Selection
The layer map was created by using **`Mapbox Studio's Outdoors`** style template [1]. In the Mapbox Studio, the open space layer was modified by increasing the intensity of its green color. Tiles were retrieved from **`QuickMetaTiles`** which through rendering, it cut the layer map into 256 x 256 pixels tiles. There were 12 tilesets reterieved from this process.<br>

**City Seattle** was chosen as the geographic area with coordinates of **`47.662725132346495 latitude`** and **`-122.33827001436774 longitude`**. <br>

The **`zoom levels of the basemap`** are set at 7 for the zoom, 12 for maximum Zoom and 2 for the minimum Zoom and **`zoom level of the tile layer`** was set at 12. The zoom levels provides us with:
- map's width and heights of  **`1,048,576 pixels `**,
- ground resolution of  **`38.125 meters/pixels`**, and
- map scale (at 96dpi) of **`1: 144, 447.93`**.
